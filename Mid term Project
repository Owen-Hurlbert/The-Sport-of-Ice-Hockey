#### The reason why I love Hockey
There are many things I could say and explain as to why I truly love this game. Between all of the memories and friends I made from playing this sport, none compare to that of out of town tournaments. With all the excitement of being in a different city and the thrills of a tournament, I find that I play some of my best and most enjoyable games. Throughout my years growing up I played hockey year-round, so by the time I graduated high school it truly hit me that hockey would soon come to an end. This is what I thought going into college, however I recently discovered that my hockey was not coming to an end but instead a _new chapter_. The _new chapter_ refers to college hockey and then adult hockey leagues for as long as I can still skate. **Adult hockey leagues** come with all different levels, so whether your just beginning or you were a stud in college there is a level for you!
